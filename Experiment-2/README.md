## 1. Project Overview

This project compares the performance of a **Virtual Machine (VM)** and a **Docker Container** using CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and FastAPI benchmarks.

The experiment measures performance, throughput, IOPS, latency, and resource usage.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Compare CPU and memory performance.
- Compare disk I/O and network performance.
- Compare FastAPI application performance.
- Analyze performance differences between VMs and containers.

---

## 3. VM vs Container

### Virtual Machine

A VM runs a complete guest operating system on virtualized hardware.

```text
Application
     ↓
Guest OS
     ↓
Virtual Hardware
     ↓
Hypervisor
     ↓
Host OS
     ↓
Physical Hardware
```

### Container

A container isolates applications while sharing the host OS kernel.

```bash
Application
     ↓
Container
     ↓
Host OS Kernel
     ↓
Physical Hardware
```

Containers generally require fewer resources because they do not need a separate guest operating system.

## 4. Experimental Setup

### VM

- Virtualization: Virtual Machine
- OS: Ubuntu
- CPU and RAM: According to the configured VM
- Storage: VM virtual disk

### Docker

- Container Technology: Docker
- Base Image: Ubuntu 24.04
- Benchmark Image: vm-container-benchmark
- FastAPI Image: performance-api

### Tools Used

Sysbench, FIO, iPerf3, Docker, ApacheBench, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Python, Git, and Linux monitoring tools.

---

## 5. Experimental Methodology

The same or equivalent workloads were executed in both environments.

### Step 1 — Prepare the Environment

Required tools were installed and verified.

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y \
sysbench fio iperf3 htop iotop sysstat \
python3 python3-pip git
```

### Step 2 — Record System Information

```bash
lscpu
free -h
lsblk
df -h
uname -a
```

### Step 3 — Run CPU Benchmark

```bash
sysbench cpu \
--cpu-max-prime=20000 \
--threads=4 \
--time=30 run
```

CPU scalability was tested using 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads.

### Step 4 — Run Memory Benchmark

```bash
sysbench memory \
--memory-block-size=1M \
--memory-total-size=10G \
--threads=4 run
```

### Step 5 — Run Disk I/O Benchmark

FIO was used for sequential and random read/write workloads.

### Step 6 — Run Network Benchmark

```bash
iperf3 -c <SERVER-IP> -t 30
iperf3 -c <SERVER-IP> -t 30 -P 4
```

### Step 7 — Run FastAPI Benchmark

ApacheBench was used to test the /health, /compute, and /memory endpoints.

```bash
ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://127.0.0.1:8000/compute
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://127.0.0.1:8000/memory
```

### Step 8 — Monitor Resources

```bash
htop
vmstat 1
docker stats
```

---

## 6. Docker Benchmark Image

A Docker image based on Ubuntu 24.04 was created with the required benchmarking tools.

```bash
FROM ubuntu:24.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
    sysbench fio iperf3 python3 python3-pip \
    procps sysstat && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /benchmark
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t vm-container-benchmark -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm vm-container-benchmark
```

## 17. Conclusion

This experiment evaluated VM and Docker performance using CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and FastAPI workloads.

The results show that performance differences depend on the workload and system configuration.

The experiment provides practical data for understanding the performance characteristics of traditional virtual machines and container-based virtualization.
